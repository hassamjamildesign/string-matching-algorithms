# String Analyzing Theorem

This repository contains a C++ implementation and analysis of fundamental string matching algorithms. 
The project explores both the theoretical concepts and practical performance of classical string searching techniques.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Brute Force String Matching
- Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
- Boyer–Moore Algorithm

## Objectives
- To understand the mathematical and theoretical basis of string analysis
- To compare time complexity and efficiency of different string matching algorithms
- To analyze pattern searching behavior on various input sizes

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of the Discrete Mathematics / Algorithm Analysis coursework.

## Author
Hassam

## Source Code
The complete implementation is available in this repository.
